# WOMBO COMBO

Inspired by the widely popular browser game [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/), we wanted to develop an online multiplayer word-merging game. Infinite Craft is a sandbox game using generative AI software where the player is given four starting elements: fire, wind, water, and earth, which can be combined to create new elements. We adapted and expanded this idea by adding objectives, a scoring system, and multiplayer capabilities.

## Technologies used

* Java
* Gradle
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* Websockets
* Google Cloud (App Engine)
* Google Vertex API (external API)

## Structure and Components

In the implementation, elements that can be combined are also called "words". So, Wombo Combo is an element-merging/word-merging game.

### Lobby management

Responsible for:

* managing players (joining, leaving)
* lobby settings (name, visibility)
* triggering gmae start and coordinating the gameplay
* broadcasting the game result to the players.

Main class:

* LobbyService: implements the lobby management logic. [Link](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-41/sopra-fs24-group-41-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/LobbyService.java)

Important helper classes:

* LobbyController (REST controller)
* PlayerService (logic used for managing individual players)

### User management

Responsible for:

* User registration
* User login
* User profile information (favorite word, number of wins and other statistics)
* Editing user data

Main class:

* UserService: implements the user management logic. [Link](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-41/sopra-fs24-group-41-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/UserService.java)

Other important classes:

* UserController (REST controller)

### Game logic

Responsible for:

* Initializing the game
* Playing moves (making combinations)
* Conditions for ending the game, criteria for determining the winner
* Game timer (how much time is left for in the current round)
* Updating player statistics (number of wins, combinations made etc.)
* Different game modes available

Main class:

* GameService: implements the higher-level game logic. [Link](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-41/sopra-fs24-group-41-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/GameService.java)

Other important classes:

* WordService: Manages words, selecting the target word (word that needs to be reached by the players in order to win)
* CombinationService: Generates word combinations (e.g., `word1` + `word2` = `resultWord`), saves them to the database.
* APIService: Manages calls to the external API for determining the resulting word for a combination (e.g., fetches the result "steam" for "water" + "fire").

## Launch & Deployment

### Prerequisites

#### Spring Boot

Spring Boot is the backbone technology in this project.

Getting started with Spring Boot:
-   Documentation: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html
-   Guides: http://spring.io/guides
    -   Building a RESTful Web Service: http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
    -   Building REST services with Spring: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/

#### Google Vertex API

Google Cloud and Vertex API:
* Set up a Google Cloud Account.
* Google Vertex API guide: [Link](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform), [getting started](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries#java).
* LLM used by our app: [Link](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-chat). Note: the LLM used by our application can be changed in `APIService.java`.
* Downloading Service account credentials: [Link](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-creds). These credentials have to be added to the environment variables of the runtime.


### Development

After setting up the Vertex API, you can now build and run the application.

#### Build

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.
-   macOS: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

More Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).


Then, you can build the project using:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can verify that the server is running by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.

#### Test

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Useful guide on testing: [link](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-testing).

#### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application once the content of a file has been changed.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`

#### API Endpoint Testing with Postman

We recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test your API Endpoints.

#### Debugging

If something is not working and/or you don't know what is going on, we recommend using a debugger and step-through the process step-by-step.

To configure a debugger for SpringBoot's Tomcat servlet (i.e. the process you start with `./gradlew bootRun` command), do the following:

1. Open Tab: **Run**/Edit Configurations
2. Add a new Remote Configuration and name it properly
3. Start the Server in Debug mode: `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm`
4. Press `Shift + F9` or the use **Run**/Debug "Name of your task"
5. Set breakpoints in the application where you need it
6. Step through the process one step at a time

#### How to do releases

We have set up a Github Actions Workflow that automatically deploys whenever code is pushed on the main branch.

* Workflow file for main commits: `main.yml`
* Workflow file for pull requests (for running tests): `pr.yml`

## Roadmap

Further versions of Wombo Combo could include these functionalities:

* Spectator mode, where clients can spectate games
* Further achievements
* Difficulty setting for target words
